Hi, I’m Matthew Bennett.
I work in marketing and digital strategy, where I focus on storytelling, content, and helping ideas connect with the right audience. Much of my work centers on financial education—finding clear, human ways to explain topics that often feel complicated or intimidating.
Over the years, I’ve worked across social media, video, paid media, and content strategy. I’m especially interested in how people learn, what earns attention in a crowded digital space, and how consistent, thoughtful communication can build trust over time.
This blog is a personal space. It’s where I write about marketing, media, personal finance, creativity, and things I’m learning along the way. Some posts will be practical. Some will be reflective. All of them are a way for me to think out loud and share what I find useful.
If something here helps you see a problem differently, sparks an idea, or makes a complex topic feel a little simpler, then this space is doing what it’s meant to do.
Thanks for stopping by.
— Matthew
