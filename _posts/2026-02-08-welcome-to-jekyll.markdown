Hi — I’m Matthew Bennett. 👋
This is the first post on my new blog, and it felt right to start with a simple introduction.
I work in marketing and digital strategy, with a focus on storytelling, content, and helping people better understand money and financial decisions. Over the years, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how brands communicate, how people learn, and how small choices add up to bigger outcomes.
This blog is a space for ideas, experiments, and lessons learned along the way. Some posts will be about marketing and media. Some will be about personal finance, creativity, or things I’m currently working on. Others might just be thoughts worth writing down.
If you’re reading this, thanks for being here at the very beginning. More to come soon.
— Matthew
